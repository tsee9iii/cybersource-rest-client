## 5. Reporting Services - ❌ 0% Coverage

**Status:** No service implemented

### Missing Reporting Endpoints

| Endpoint                                                  | HTTP | Use Case                       |

## 6. TSS (Transaction Search Services) - ❌ 0% Coverage

**Status:** No service implemented

### Missing TSS Endpoints

| Endpoint           | HTTP | Use Case                                   |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/tss/v2/searches` | POST | Search transactions with flexible criteria |

**Impact:** Cannot search transaction history by various criteria (date ranges, amounts, card types, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Add to `payment.service.ts` or create dedicated search service.

---

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Core Payment Enhancements (Medium Priority)

Add missing PTS endpoints to `payment.service.ts`:

- Standalone credits/voids
- Payment intents
- Payout support
- Transaction batch queries

### Priority 2: Risk Services (High Priority if Fraud Prevention Needed)

Create `risk.service.ts` if your application requires:

- Fraud detection/scoring
- 3D Secure authentication
- Export compliance screening

### Priority 3: Reporting Services (Low Priority)

Create `reporting.service.ts` if automated reporting is required:

- Most merchants use CyberSource Business Center for reports
- Automated report retrieval typically used for:
  - Integration with accounting systems
  - Automated reconciliation
  - Custom analytics dashboards

### Priority 4: Transaction Search (Medium Priority)

Add search capabilities:

- Useful for customer service inquiries
- Transaction lookup by various criteria
- Could be added to `payment.service.ts`

---

## Current State Assessment

✅ **Excellent Coverage:**

- **TMS (Token Management):** 100% - All endpoints for customer, payment instrument, and token management fully covered
- **RBS (Recurring Billing):** 100% - Complete plan and subscription lifecycle management

⚠️ **Partial Coverage:**

- **PTS (Payments):** 30% - Core payment operations covered, but missing advanced features

❌ **Not Covered:**

- **Risk Services:** 0% - No fraud prevention or 3DS authentication
- **Reporting:** 0% - No automated report retrieval
- **Transaction Search:** 0% - No flexible transaction search

### Overall Assessment

**The NestJS wrapper provides comprehensive coverage (100%) of the two most critical API sections:**

1. **Token Management (TMS)** - Essential for PCI compliance and secure payment storage
2. **Recurring Billing (RBS)** - Essential for subscription business models

**For basic payment processing, the current coverage is sufficient:**

- Create payments (auth + capture)
- Authorize, capture, refund, void operations
- Token and customer management
- Subscription management

**Missing functionality is primarily for advanced use cases:**

- Advanced payment workflows (intents, billing agreements, payouts)
- Fraud prevention (if not using built-in Decision Manager during payment processing)
- Automated reporting (most use Business Center UI)
- Transaction search (can use Business Center UI for ad-hoc searches)

---

## Conclusion

**53% overall API coverage**, but **100% coverage of the two most critical sections (TMS + RBS)**.

The missing 47% is primarily:

- Advanced payment features (16 PTS endpoints)
- Fraud prevention services (10 Risk endpoints)
- Reporting services (19 endpoints)
- Transaction search (1 endpoint)

For most e-commerce applications, the current implementation provides all essential functionality. Additional services can be added based on specific business requirements.
